# Coffee Mania

This project is a virtual coffee machine interface using computer vision techniques with OpenCV and the `cvzone` library. The program uses hand gestures detected through a webcam to simulate a user interface for selecting coffee types and other options.

## Features

- Real-time hand tracking and gesture recognition using a webcam.
- Interactive user interface simulated with images.
- Selection of different coffee options based on hand gestures.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/akansh30/Coffee_Machine_OpenCV.git
   cd Coffee_Machine_OpenCV

2. **Install Dependencies**:

It's recommended to use a virtual environment. If you are not using one, you can skip to installing dependencies.

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```

3. **Requirements**:
   
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. **Run the project**:

Ensure your webcam is connected and run the script:

```bash
